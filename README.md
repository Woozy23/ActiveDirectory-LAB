Title: Active Directory Lab: Multi-Client Domain Environment

Overview

Designed and deployed a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller in a Virtualbox environment, after I configured Active Directory DNS, and Group Policy, and joined multiple Windows 10 pro client machines to the domain. I created users,groups, and applied GPOs to enforce security policies and manage access.


Architecture

- DC: Windows Server 2022 (Active Directory and DNS)
- Client: Windows 10 Pro
- Network: Virtual Internal Network and NAT for internet
